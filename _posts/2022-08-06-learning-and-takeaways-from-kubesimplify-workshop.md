This post will keep the learning process and takeaways from the Kubesimplify workshops held by Saiyam Pathak. The motivation for me to catch up on this is to systematically learning by practising for DevOps mindset, in order to achieve double blade, Data Engineering + DevOps.

### Workshop 1: Familiar with basic Linux commands

I've been familiar with most of the commands introduced in this session. I still learnt something new because my learning before wasn't systematical enough. The takeaways for me in this session are listed below:

1. Knowing the naming and how Linux filesystem works in a clear picture.

2. Pressing `control + r` in the prompt is able to search historical executions. Under z-shell, there's a way fancier drop-down list for a more intuitive search.
3. Using Command `man` to look up the manual of each command. `-h` isn't supported for every command, learnt how to use `man` is a great finding for me.
