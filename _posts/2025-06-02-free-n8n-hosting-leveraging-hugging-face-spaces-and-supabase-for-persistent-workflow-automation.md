## Introduction

n8n, the fair-code workflow automation platform, has transformed how developers and businesses automate their processes. While self-hosting n8n typically requires dedicated infrastructure, this guide demonstrates an innovative approach: hosting n8n entirely free using Hugging Face Spaces for compute and Supabase for persistent storage.

This architecture addresses a critical limitation of Hugging Face's free tierâ€”ephemeral storageâ€”by offloading workflow persistence to Supabase's generous free database tier. The result is a production-ready n8n instance without infrastructure costs, perfect for individuals, small teams, or proof-of-concept deployments.

## Architecture Overview

The solution leverages two complementary platforms:

**Hugging Face Spaces** provides:
- Free Docker container hosting
- 2 vCPU and 16GB RAM (free tier)
- Public HTTPS endpoint
- Automatic container management

**Supabase** delivers:
- PostgreSQL database (500MB free tier)
- Row-level security
- Real-time subscriptions
- Built-in authentication

This combination circumvents Hugging Face's ephemeral storage limitation while maintaining the performance characteristics needed for reliable workflow automation.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:
- A Hugging Face account (free signup at huggingface.co)
- A Supabase account (free signup at supabase.com)
- Basic familiarity with Docker and environment variables
- Git installed locally

## Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

First, create the PostgreSQL backend that will store your n8n workflows, credentials, and execution history.

### Create a New Supabase Project

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "New project"
3. Configure your project:
   - **Name**: `n8n-backend`
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose the closest to your primary users
4. Wait for project provisioning (typically 2-3 minutes)

### Configure Database Schema

n8n requires specific database tables and permissions. Navigate to the SQL editor in your Supabase dashboard and execute:

```sql
-- Create n8n schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS n8n;

-- Grant permissions to authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA n8n TO postgres;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA n8n TO postgres;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA n8n TO postgres;

-- Enable UUID extension for n8n
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

### Retrieve Connection Details

From your Supabase project settings, collect:
- **Host**: Found under Settings â†’ Database
- **Port**: Typically 5432
- **Database name**: Usually 'postgres'
- **User**: 'postgres'
- **Password**: The password you created earlier

Your connection string will look like:
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## Step 2: Create Hugging Face Space

Now, set up the compute environment for n8n.

### Initialize Space Repository

1. Navigate to huggingface.co/spaces
2. Click "Create new Space"
3. Configure:
   - **Space name**: `n8n-workflow-automation`
   - **SDK**: Docker
   - **Visibility**: Public (required for free tier)
4. Clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/[YOUR-USERNAME]/n8n-workflow-automation
cd n8n-workflow-automation
```

### Create Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` that configures n8n with Supabase integration:

```dockerfile
FROM n8nio/n8n:latest

# Install PostgreSQL client for better database compatibility
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache postgresql-client

# Create data directory with proper permissions
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/.n8n && \
    chown -R node:node /home/node/.n8n

USER node

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /home/node

# Expose n8n port
EXPOSE 5678

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=30s \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:5678/healthz || exit 1

# Start n8n
CMD ["n8n", "start"]
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file template (don't commit actual values):

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_TYPE=postgresdb
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=your-project.supabase.co
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=postgres
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=postgres
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=n8n

# n8n Configuration
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
N8N_HOST=0.0.0.0
N8N_PORT=5678
N8N_PROTOCOL=https
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-space.hf.space

# Execution Configuration
EXECUTIONS_MODE=regular
EXECUTIONS_PROCESS=main
N8N_METRICS=false

# Security
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-char-encryption-key
```

### Create Space Configuration

Add a `README.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown

# n8n Workflow Automation Platform

This Space hosts a fully functional n8n instance with persistent storage via Supabase.

## Features
- Complete n8n workflow automation
- Persistent workflow storage
- Secure credential management
- Webhook support
- API integrations

## Access
Visit the Space URL and log in with the configured credentials.
```

## Step 3: Deploy and Configure

### Set Hugging Face Secrets

In your Space settings, add these secrets:
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Variables and secrets
2. Add each environment variable from your `.env` file
3. Mark sensitive values (passwords, keys) as "Secret"

### Initial Deployment

Push your configuration:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial n8n configuration"
git push origin main
```

Hugging Face will automatically build and deploy your container. Monitor the logs for any issues.

### Verify Database Connection

Once deployed, access your n8n instance and verify:
1. Navigate to `https://[your-space].hf.space`
2. Log in with your basic auth credentials
3. Create a test workflow
4. Restart the Space (Settings â†’ Restart)
5. Confirm your workflow persists

## Step 4: Configure n8n for Production Use

### Enable Webhook URLs

For webhook-triggered workflows, configure the public URL:

1. In n8n settings, set Webhook URL to your Space URL
2. Test with a simple webhook workflow:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Webhook",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
      "position": [250, 300],
      "webhookId": "test-webhook",
      "parameters": {
        "path": "test",
        "responseMode": "onReceived",
        "responseData": "allEntries"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Set Up Credentials Encryption

n8n encrypts stored credentials using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Generate a secure key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Update this in your Space secrets to ensure credential security.

### Configure Execution Retention

To manage database growth within Supabase's free tier, configure execution pruning:

```bash
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=none
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=true
EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168  # 7 days
```

## Optimization and Best Practices

### Performance Tuning

1. **Connection Pooling**: Configure n8n's database connection pool:
```bash
DB_POSTGRESDB_POOL_MIN=2
DB_POSTGRESDB_POOL_MAX=10
```

2. **Memory Management**: Monitor Space metrics and adjust workflow complexity accordingly

3. **Webhook Response Times**: Keep webhook workflows lightweight to avoid timeouts

### Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Always enable basic authentication or implement OAuth
2. **Network Security**: Use Supabase's connection pooler for additional security
3. **Credential Rotation**: Regularly update passwords and API keys
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable n8n's audit logs for compliance

### Backup Strategy

Implement regular backups despite the free tier limitations:

```bash
# Weekly backup script (run locally)
pg_dump -h your-project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -n n8n > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```
